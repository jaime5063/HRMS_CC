/* Collection
 * 
 * Maps
 * 	- All keys must be unique
 * 
 *  Why do we need them?
 *  - store multiple objects and then store them into 1 entity	
 * Map: 
 * 	- Store 2 objects in the form of <key, value>
 * 
 * 								HashMap v.s HashTable
 *  Similarity - both do not maintain the order of inserter keys
 * 	Difference - HTable is synchronized(thread-safe) where HMap is not
 * 			   - HTable does not allow null keys nor null values, where HashMap allows
 * 
 * 							  LinkedHashMap v.s TreeMap
 * - TreeMap stores key objects in ascending order, 
 * 		where linkedHashMap keep insertion order of keys.
 * - TreetMap does not allow null keys, LinkedHashMap we can have null keys and null values.
