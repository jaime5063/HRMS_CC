/* EXCEPTION:
 *  - Occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal
 *  	flow of the program's instructions.
 *  
 *  - object which is thrown at runtime.
 *  
 *  - When Exception occurs system generates an error message.
 *  	We can manage this using exception handler.
 *  
 *  - The process of converting system error messages into 
 *  	user friendly error message is known as Exception handling.
 *
 *  - If you get an exception during the program
 *  	BUT you want to complete you program, you will have to do:
 *  	"Exception Handling"
 * 
 *  Example: 
 *  For instance exceptions are used to let the user know that what they are 
 *  trying to do is not acceptable for the application/code to process it, for instance in my 
 *  company if a username or password has invalid data it tosses an exception and it tells the 
 *  user what the exception means
 * 
 * Error - something that we cannot handle (out of memory error)
 * 		Will occur because of lack of system resources.
 * 
 * 
 * Exception - is an Object that is thrown at the runtime and this object
 * 		we CAN handle. (with a program)
 * 
 * 2 Types of exceptions we have:
 * - checked = compile time exceptions (will occur when we are trying to compile the code)
 * 		you will have to handle it otherwise your code wont compile.
 * 
 * - unchecked = this type of exception not checked by the compiler 
 * 		(ArithmeticException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException).
 * 
 * 5 EXEPTION HANDLING KEYWORDS
 * - try
 * 
 * 
 * To handle any exception we can use try and catch block
 * - Try block: will consist of any code that might throw an exception
 * - Catch block: is block that need to catch the object of the thrown exception
 * 		inside block we must provide matching Exception type.
 * 
 * note: provide message for the exception:
 * 1  .printStackTrace(); --> details of where in the code exceptions occurred,
 * 							  name of the exception and detailed message.
 * 
 * 2  SYSOln(e) put in the variable name you put --> name of exception and message.
 * 
 * 3  SYSOln(e.getMessage()); --> message of the exception.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *
