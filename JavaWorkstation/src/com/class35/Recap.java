/* SET INTERFACE:
 * - SET is a collections that stores objects and group of objects without duplicates
 * 
 *  - LIST is a collection that store group of objects in which duplicates are allowed
 *    and insertion order is preserved.
 *    
 *  3 classes that implements Set:
 *  - HashSet: collection that does not maintain link order
 *  - LinkedHashSet: Collections that maintains the insertion order
 *  - TreeSet: collection that stores object in ascending order  
 *  
 *  Creating the object of any Set:
 *  	Set<Doubole> set = HashSet<>();
 *  	set.add(90.99);
 *  	set.add(90.99);
 *  	set.add(9.99);
 *  
 *  	Set<Doubole> set = TreeSet<>();
 *  	set.add(90.99);
 *  	set.add(90.99);
 *  	set.add(9.99);
 *  
 *  	Set<Doubole> set = LinkedHashSet<>();
 *  	set.add(90.99);
 *  	set.add(90.99);
 *  	set.add(9.99);
 *  
 *  Retrieve Objects from Set: (elements)
 *   - 1. Iterator
 *  Iterator<Double> iterator = set/iterator();
 *  while(iterator.hasNext()){
 *  	Double d = iterator.next();
 *  }
 *  Note: For loop does NOT work -  does not have get().
 *  Note: you can also use UNBOXING on line 35
 *  	double d = iterator.next();
 *  
 *  - 2.
 *  
 *  To retrieve values from array:
 *  - for loop
 *  - enhanced for loop
 *   
 * ArrayList vs HashSet?
 * 	AL - has duplicates and preserves order
 * 	HS - does not allow duplicates does Not preserve order
 * 
 *  AL - methods get and set available
 *  HS - get and set Not available
 *   
 *  
 *  
 *
