	/* COLLECTIONS: is a framework
	 * 
	 * - Collection Framework Hierarchy
	 * - Collection Interfaces
	 * - Collection List
	 * - Collection Queue
	 * - Collection Set
	 * 
	 * Basically a multi-value container
	 * - store and manipulate objects
	 * 
	 * Iterable
	 *  - COLLECTION
	 *  	- List
	 *  		ArrayList
	 *  		LinkedList
	 *  		Vector
	 *  		Stack (might not use at all)
	 *  	- Queue
	 *  		Priority Queue
	 *  	- Set
	 *  		HashSet
	 *  		LinkedHashSet
	 *  
	 *  Iterator - iterator interface provides the facility of iterating the elements only in a forward direction
	 *  	Methods: public boolean hashSet()	public Object next()	public void remove()
	 *  
	 *  
	 *  Iterable - iterable interface is the root interface for all the collection classes.
	 *  		   The collection interface along with all its subclasses also implement the iterable interface.
	 *  	Methods: Iterator<T> iterator()
	 *  
	 *  
	 *  Collection - Collection interface is implemented by all the classes in the collection framework & declares
	 *  		   the methods that every collection will contain
	 *  	Methods: Boolean add(Object obj)	Boolean addAll(Object obj)	void clear()	
	 *  
	 *  
	 *  Java List: List is an interface that extends the Collection and contains ordered collection of elements 
	 *  		   including duplicate values.
	 *  - ArrayList
	 *  
	 *  - LinkedList: 
	 *  	- Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items.
	 *  	- Each link contains a connection to another link
	 *  		Example: Linkedlist object = new Linkedlist(); 
	 *  	- Singly Linked List = Each node i this list stores the data of the node and a pointer or reference to 
	 *  	  the next node in the list.
	 *  	- Doubly Linked List =
	 *  	
	 *  
	 *  - Vector
